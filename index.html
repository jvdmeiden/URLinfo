  <h3>Uniform Resource Locator Info</h3>
  <h4>Background</h4>
  <p>The line displayed by web browsers above the page in an address bar is a 
     'Uniform Resource Locator' or URL. The specification for a URL is laid down in
     <a href="http://www.rfc-base.org/txt/rfc-1738.txt ">rfc-1738</a>. </br>
     Most common URLs are made up of these components: </br>
      <pre>  scheme           host         port             path          query                         

 >>-http://--+-host name--+--+--------+--/--path component--?-query--#fragment--
             '-IP address-'  '-:-port-'                      </pre>
</p>
     <ul><li>Scheme: identifies the protocol to be used to access the resource on the Internet. 
             For instance 'http', 'https', 'ftp' etc.</li>
          <li>Host (or IP address): identifies the host that holds the resource. For example, www.example.com. 
              For one hostname there may be many servers, or vice versa one server may provide services for many hostnames.</li>
          <li>Port number: is optional, will default to common values like 80 for http.</li>
          <li>Path: identifies the specific resource in the host that the web client wants to access. For example, /software/index.html.</li>
          <li>Query string and fragments: if used, it follows the path component, and provides a string of information that the resource can use for some purpose.<br/>
              For example tell 'Bing' to look for images of 'panda': <a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=panda">http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=panda</a>
          </li></ul>
  <h4>This Site</h4>
  Occasionally you may want to have addional information on a Uniform Resource Locator. That may be
  out of plain curiosity or because a URL seems to be pointing at a suspicious location like 'our fraud 
  team blocked your credit card: click &gthere&lt to .. '
</p>
<p>
<h4>Hostnames</h4>
First the hostname: it resolves to one or more IP addresses (unless the name is not found..). Per IP address we can lookup its location and (in many cases) do a reverse lookup.
<pre>
                                             .- location
                           .--- IP address --+
                           .                 .- reverse name 
                           .
                           .                 .- location
hostname &gt- resolves to &gt--+--- IP address --+
                           .                 .- reverse name
                           .
                           .                 .- location 
                           .--- IP address --+
                                             .- reverse name
</pre>

<h4>Redirections</h4>
Quite often when a browser connects to a URL, the server wil redirect to a new url, quite comm
<pre>
           .--- Redirects --+
           .                 .
           v                 ^
           .                 .
URL -- &gt---+-----------------+---- &gt-

<h4>Server information</h4>
When succesfully connected to a server, this server may (or may not) send technical information back in its http header fields.
<h4>Certificates</h4>
The information contained in certificates can be interesting.
