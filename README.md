## Synopsis

Resources on the web are identified by URL's (Uniform Resource Locators).

On many occasions some additional background to a URL is interesting.

Some URL's may point to malicious resources.

This repository contains 'work in progress' on the site http://uniformresourcelocator.info/ and tooling used there.
